This test should output four plots of expected and calculated neutrino energy density vs. electron fraction, one plot for each of four temperatures.

THEORY:
The neutrinos should follow a blackbody Planck distribution, where E is the neutrino energy and mu is the equilibrium neutrino chemical potential given by (mu_nu = mu_p + mu_e - mu_n) for the electron neutrino, and negative this for the electron anti-neutrino, and zero for the heavy lepton neutrinos.
B_nu(T) = (E^3 / (hc)^2) / ( Exp((E+mu)/(kT)) + 1 )    [erg/cm^2/ster/Hz/s]
Multiply by 4*Pi/c to get the energy density of each neutrino species 
(energy density)_nu = (4*Pi*E^3 / (h^2*c^3)) / ( Exp((E+mu)/(kT)) + 1 )    [erg/cm^3/Hz]
Integrate over neutrino energy to get the net energy density of a given species.
(energy density) = (4*Pi / (hc)^3) Integrate[ E^3*dE / (Exp(E/kT + mu/kT) + 1)]
                 = (4*Pi / (hc)^3) Integrate[ x^3*dx / (Exp(x + mu/kT) + 1)] (1/kT)^4       [x=E/kT]
		 = 4*Pi (hc)^-3 (kT)^4 (-6 PolyLog[4,-Exp(-mu/kT)])       [erg/cm^3]
If the neutrinos happen to have zero chemical potential, this corresponds to
               --> 4*Pi (hc)^-3 (kT)^4 (7*Pi^4/120)                      [erg/cm^3]

TESTS:
For rho=10^12 g/ccm
For each of T={0.1,1,10,100} MeV
For each of Ye={0.035,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.55}
Create a single sphere with {rho,T,Ye}. The weak interaction timescale should be <~ 10^-3s everywhere, so set dt=1s (the radiation field should have plenty of time to relax to the fluid temperature).
Read out the neutrino energy density of each species (e,anti-e,x).
Get mu_nu from the EOS, determine the expected energy density based on the above.
Compare.
