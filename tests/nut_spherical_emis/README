This test should output spectra of the three neutrino species in NuLib's simplest scheme (i.e. \nu_e, \bar{\nu}_e, and \nu_x) along with theoretical predictions. The predicted line should be a bit below the measurements because the range of the spectrum is not as wide as the distribution, but the full luminosity gets put into it.

To run the test just execute "make". This assumes "make tests" has been run in the base directory.
