This test should output plots of the spectra emerging from a toy ball that is almost optically thin. There is no central source, and all of the emission comes from in the zone. The plotted lines are the blackbody curves, which are not expected to match. They are just there for comparison. Blackbody assumes equipartition, but it is clear that in this situation there are far more electron and anti-electron neutrinos than other types. Therefore, the spectrum for anti/electron neutrinos is larger than predicted by blackbody, and the luminosity of the other kinds is smaller than is predicted by blackbody. To run the test just execute "make". This assumes that "make tests" was run in the base directory.
