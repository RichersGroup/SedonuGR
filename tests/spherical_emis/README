This test should output spectra of the three neutrino species in NuLib's simplest scheme (i.e. \nu_e, \bar{\nu}_e, and \nu_x) along with theoretical predictions. With a positive core_nue_chem_pot, it is expected that more electron neutrios are emitted and fewer electron anti-neutrinos are emitted than with zero chemical potential. There is some blockiness in the spectrum that is just a reflection of the NuLib table's frequency resolution.

To run the test just execute "make".
