This test should produce a photon blackbody spectrum with the temperature and luminosity indicated by the parameter file. A plot to compare the two is automatically generated.  The predicted line should be a bit below the measurements because the range of the spectrum is not as wide as the distribution, but the full luminosity gets put into it.

To generate the data and the plot just execute "make". Assumes that "make tests" has already been run in the base directory.
