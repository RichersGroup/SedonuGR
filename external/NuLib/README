If transporting neutrinos, we need to be able to calculate the neutrino opacities. We use Evan O'Connor's NuLib,
which takes as input a tabulated equation of state and outputs neutrino opacities, emissivities, blackbody functions,
and scattering kernels. It is publicly available at 

nulib.org

Required files are the table that NuLib generates (e.g. NuLib.h5) and the compiled fortran module file (nulibtable.mod).
You will have to compile and run NuLib yourself to get the table.
