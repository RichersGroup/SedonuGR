// NuLib
If transporting neutrinos, we need to be able to calculate the neutrino opacities. We use Evan O'Connor's NuLib,
which takes as input a tabulated equation of state and outputs neutrino opacities, emissivities, blackbody functions,
and scattering kernels. It is publicly available at nulib.org


// HDF5
This is a library required by NuLib. It must be compiled with the same fortran compiler version that will be used to compile NuLib. This should be done autmoatically if you use the make system to build everything.
